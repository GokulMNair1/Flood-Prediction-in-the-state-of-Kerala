# Flood-Prediction-in-the-state-of-Kerala
Using the Rainfall rate the prediction will be done to know whether the flood occurs or not. Machine Learning algorithm are been used iin back end the machine learning algorithms like Random forest, SVM, K Nearest NeighNeighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree but the accuracy was found more using Support Vector Machine(Classifier). In this no specific feature is used because every feature is important. Validation will be shown when a non-numeric data is inserted. Only int, float values will be taken into consider. 

## Python Libraries 
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Tkinter
4. Pickle
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
